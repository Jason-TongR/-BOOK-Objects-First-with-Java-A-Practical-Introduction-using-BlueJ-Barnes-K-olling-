This project provides a partial implementation of a simulation of
taxis operating on a city grid to pick up and transport passengers.

This is a JavaFX implementation of the fourth stage of this project. 
It illustrates the implementation of operation with multiple taxis.
It also shows how to do a continuing animation with JavaFX, for further
self-study.

Use this version to explore further development ideas, such
as implementation of the Shuttle class.

How to start this project:
    Invoke the Simulation class via the 'Run JavaFX Application' function.
